The issue might be caused by several factors. One common cause is that the parent element has `pointer-events: none;` applied to it. This prevents child elements from receiving hover events.  Another cause could be a conflicting JavaScript event listener that is preventing the default `:hover` behavior from taking place. The solution below addresses the parent element issue.  If the problem persists, investigate JavaScript event listeners.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.parent-element {
  pointer-events: auto; /* Ensure hover events propagate */
}

/* Rest of the CSS rules, including the :hover styles */
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```
