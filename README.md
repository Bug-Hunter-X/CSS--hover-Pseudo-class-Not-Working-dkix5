# CSS :hover Pseudo-class Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class fails to apply the expected styling to certain elements. The issue is not related to incorrect selectors or syntax errors, but rather a less common circumstance that can be tricky to identify.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` presents the solution.  This repository will help you understand and solve this unusual CSS problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` (not included here, it would contain basic HTML structure with elements that should trigger the :hover effect.)
3. Observe that the hover effect is not working on the target elements, as expected.
4. Compare `bug.css` with `bugSolution.css` to see how the problem was resolved.
